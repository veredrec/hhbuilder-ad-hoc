# Household builder

## Ad Hoc Project Application

### The Idea:

Your application needs a way to capture information about a household applying for health insurance coverage. Develop a UI for building a household up from individual people.

### Task:

You have been given an HTML page with a form and a placeholder for displaying a household.

In the given index.js file, replace the "Your code goes here" comment with JavaScript that can:

* Validate data entry (age is required and > 0, relationship is required)
* Add people to a growing household list
* Remove a previously added person from the list
* Display the household list in the HTML as it is modified
* Serialize the household as JSON upon form submission as a fake trip to the server
  Notes

Do not modify the given index.html file in any way. You're of course still allowed to modify the DOM through Javascript.
